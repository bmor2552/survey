# Hero Villain Survey
Growing up, I have always been a fan of action films. My current favorites live in the Marvel Multiverse. DC is cool too, but I have chosen a side. Sorry.

# The Idea 
With this project I wanted to create a form that predicts what type of character you would be if you were in a comic flick, villain or hero.

The survey is deigned to be a landing page. I will return to this project to add functionality using JavaScript. 

# The Conclusion 
With this project I was able to experiment with css by creating a linear gradient for both the back ground image as well as the surveys background. 

I struggled a bit with small bugs (comma here and a closing tag there), but overall I am satisfied with the outcome of the landing page. 

# The Outcome
Below you will find the link to the landing page:
